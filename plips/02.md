# PLIP-02

## Communication protocol spec

`draft` `optional`

This PLIP defines the network communication that can be implemented by clients to improve user experience in the highly interactive flow required to execute contracts.

## Contract json

The base contract json should be extended with the key "communication" as follows:

```json
{
    ...
    "communication": {
        "type": <string containing the communication type - initially nostr>,
        "identifiers": {
            "clients": [
                <party identifier provided by communication type>,
                ...
            ],
            "arbitrators": [
                <party identifier provided by communication type>,
                ...
            ],
            "mediators": [
                <party identifier provided by communication type>,
                ...
            ],
        },
    },
    ...
}
